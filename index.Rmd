  Welcome to the weekly report of iNaturalist and eBird records. These are all observations submitted   from `r start` to `r end` for the species that Acadia National Park managers have identified as       being of particular interest. 
  
  These data for this report comes from open source citizen science projects: iNaturalist and eBird.    The records here are both casual and research grade observations, so erroneous identifications are    possible.
