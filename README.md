# National Park Foundation Capacity Building Project

The goal of this project is to use citizen science data from a diversity of platforms,
to gather the wealth of knowledge that exists within them. With these resources, we
have created a shiny app to present recent citizen science findings to the public
and park managers. Our model is specific to Acadia National Park, but can be applied to
any national park, or any other conservation lands with a little more effort.

The data pulled span 1 week prior to the current date (this can be changed), and are
updated in app once daily.
