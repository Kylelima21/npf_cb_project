Greetings all! I wanted to show you this graph.
If I had more to say, I could use formatting like _italics_ and **bold**. HTML css works, too, such as <span style='color:red;'>changing font color</span>.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("MPG by Weight")
```
